# University Recycling Project Website Mockup

## Description

Website mockup created for a university project where the aim was to create an innovative sustainability initiative for campus. The initiative was called "Recyclab" and was designed to be a recycling station where students could recycle old project materials to be used by other students.

The implemented user interface would be a web application that would allow users to deposit their project materials and browse materials that had been deposited by other students.

The website was accompanied by a SolidWorks design for a recycling station that would measure dimensions and weight of materials to be deposited.

The website mockup was created using HTML and CSS, future development if the initiative progressed further would involve implementing user login, item depositing, and item browsing functionality.

## Learning Outcomes

- Create a website mockup using HTML and CSS
